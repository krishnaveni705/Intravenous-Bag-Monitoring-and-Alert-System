# Intravenous Bag Monitoring and Alert System

## Overview

This project is an Intravenous (IV) Bag Monitoring and Alert System designed to enhance patient safety and streamline medical management. The system automatically monitors the IV fluid level, turns off the infusion when the liquid is completed, and sends an alert to the medical staff when the fluid is about to be depleted.

## Features

- Real-time monitoring of IV fluid levels.
- Automatic shut-off of the IV infusion when the fluid is depleted.
- Alerts sent to medical staff when the fluid level is low.
- User-friendly interface for monitoring and alert management.
- Easy integration with existing medical systems.

## Installation

To set up the IV Bag Monitoring and Alert System, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/iv-bag-monitoring-system.git
    cd iv-bag-monitoring-system
    ```

2. Install the necessary software for the microcontroller (e.g., Arduino IDE).

3. Upload the Embedded C code to the microcontroller:
    - Open the Arduino IDE.
    - Connect your microcontroller to your computer.
    - Load the project code (located in the `embedded_code` directory).
    - Compile and upload the code to the microcontroller.

## Usage

To use the IV Bag Monitoring and Alert System, follow these steps:

1. Ensure all hardware components are properly connected and the software is installed on the microcontroller.
2. Power on the system.
3. Monitor the IV fluid levels through the interface and receive alerts as configured.

## Hardware Requirements

- Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino, Raspberry Pi)
- Load cell or weight sensor to measure the IV bag weight
- Relay module to control the IV infusion
- Wi-Fi or GSM module for alert notifications
- Power supply and connecting cables

## Software Requirements

- Arduino IDE (for Embedded C code)
- Libraries: `WiFi`, `GSM`, and other relevant libraries for sensor and module interfacing.

## System Architecture

The system architecture includes the following components:

1. **Sensor Module:** Measures the weight of the IV bag and sends data to the microcontroller.
2. **Control Module:** The microcontroller processes the sensor data and controls the relay module to turn off the infusion.
3. **Communication Module:** Sends alerts to the medical staff via Wi-Fi or GSM.
4. **User Interface:** Provides a dashboard for real-time monitoring of the IV fluid levels and alert management.
